# Download from Networkrepository #

The bash script [download-networks.sh](download-networks.sh) lets you
download multiple networks specified by their name from
[networkrepository.com](https://networkrepository.com).  To specify
the networks you want to download, just edit the script accordingly;
it should be self-explanatory.
