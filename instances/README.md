This folder contains some small real-world networks.  The source of
these graph is [konect.cc](https://konect.cc), which is unfortunately
offline right now.

Additional networks can be downloaded from
[networkrepository.com](https://networkrepository.com).  This site is
somewhat overloaded with javascript, which makes downloading a bunch
of networks unpleasant.  For a script to download networks
semi-automatically, see [download](./download/).
