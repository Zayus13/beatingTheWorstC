# Beating the Worst Case #

This small framework serves as a starting point for the practical
course _"Beating the Worst Case in Practice: Unerwartet effiziente
Algorithmen"_.  As participant, you probably want to fork this
repository and start from there.

The core of the framework is in [code](./code); see the
[readme](./code/README.md) there for more information.  Moreover,
[instances](./instances) includes some small instances for initial
testing.  The folder [evaluation](./evaluation) is empty, but we
suggest you put your evaluation script and data there.
